# Next15-Tailwindcss-FastAPI-Prisma-Turbo 🏎️

This is a test

Lightweight Next 15 frontend, FastAPI server, shared Prisma ORM, and excellent dev tooling. Fully configured `tailwindcss`, `typescript`, and `.env` files. Everything you need to start your next failed side project.

## Quick Start

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Why Python?

Oftentimes a Next.js frontend will call Python libraries, which may influence state and make changes to the DB. Examples include audio/video processing and machine learning. It's ideal to therefore work with a single ORM and a single schema file - a single source of truth.
